Nutella Calzone:

Ingredients:

1 tub nutella
1 egg, lightly beaten
FOR THE DOUGH
2 cups self raising plain flour
1 cup natural yoghurt
1 tbsp brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon sugar

Method:
1. Using the dough paddle, place the flour, yoghurt and salt into your magimix food processor, blend for 10 to 20 seconds until dough forms.
   Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured bench.
2. Knead gently to form a smooth, very soft pastry, it may seem a little wet but a light dusting of flour will fix this.
3. Wrap in cling film and rest for 30 minutes.
4. When ready to use, divide into small golf ball sized portions. Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured work surface into circle shapes.
5. Place a spoonful of nutella in the centre of each circle of pastry.
6. Brush the edges with a little water and fold over to create half moon shapes. Press edges to seal. Brush the top with beaten egg. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.
7. Transfer to a lightly greased tray and bake in a preheated 220C oven for 20 minutes or until golden brown.
