Desserts:

1. Nutella Calzone

Ingredients:

1 tub nutella
1 egg, lightly beaten
FOR THE DOUGH
2 cups self raising plain flour
1 cup natural yoghurt
1 tbsp brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon sugar

Method:
1. Using the dough paddle, place the flour, yoghurt and salt into your magimix food processor, blend for 10 to 20 seconds until dough forms.
   Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured bench.
2. Knead gently to form a smooth, very soft pastry, it may seem a little wet but a light dusting of flour will fix this.
3. Wrap in cling film and rest for 30 minutes.
4. When ready to use, divide into small golf ball sized portions. Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured work surface into circle shapes.
5. Place a spoonful of nutella in the centre of each circle of pastry.
6. Brush the edges with a little water and fold over to create half moon shapes. Press edges to seal. Brush the top with beaten egg. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.
7. Transfer to a lightly greased tray and bake in a preheated 220C oven for 20 minutes or until golden brown.


2. Tiramisu

Ingredients:

568ml pot double cream
250g tub mascarpone
75ml marsala
5 tbsp golden caster sugar
300ml strong coffee, made with 2 tbsp coffee granules and 300ml boiling water
175g pack sponge finger
25g chunk dark chocolate
2 tsp cocoa powder

Method: 
1. Put a 568ml pot double cream, 250g tub mascarpone, 75ml marsala and 5 tbsp golden caster sugar in a large bowl.
2. Whisk until the cream and mascarpone have completely combined and have the consistency of thickly whipped cream.
3. Pour 300ml strong coffee (made with 2 tbsp coffee granules and 300ml boiling water) into a shallow dish.
4. Dip in a few of the 175g pack of sponge fingers at a time, turning for a few secs until they are nicely soaked, but not soggy. Layer these into your dish until you have used half the sponge fingers, then spread over half of the creamy mixture.
5. Using the coarse side of the grater, grate over most of the 25g dark chocolate. Then repeat the layers (you should use up all the coffee), finishing with the creamy layer.
6. Cover and chill for a few hours or overnight. This can now be kept in the fridge for up to 2 days. 
7. To serve, dust with 2 tsp cocoa powder and grate over the remainder of the chocolate.
