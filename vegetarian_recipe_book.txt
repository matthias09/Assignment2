2. Broccoli and Potato Croquettes

Ingredients:
400g floury potatoes
150g broccoli
1 medium egg yolk
40g mature cheddar, grated
60g fresh breadcrumbs

For the crust
20g plain flour
2 medium eggs beaten
100g sesame seeds
4 tbsp olive oil

For the dip
100g cream cheese
50g natural yogurt
1 tbsp chives, snipped
1-2 tbsp full-fat milk

Method:
1. Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan and just cover with cold water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 14-16 mins until completely cooked through. Drain and mash well, then put back in the saucepan over a low heat and cook for 1-2 mins, stirring constantly – this will remove excess moisture.
2. Meanwhile, bring a small saucepan of water to the boil, add the broccoli and simmer for 6-7 mins until tender. Drain really well and pat dry with kitchen paper (it’s important to do this thoroughly as excess water will make the croquettes a little wet). Finely chop the broccoli, then add to the mashed potato with the egg yolk, cheese and breadcrumbs. Divide the mixture into 12 equal balls and roll each one into a short sausage shape. Chill for 10 mins in the freezer.
3. Meanwhile, make the dip. Put the cream cheese, yogurt and chives in a bowl and stir to a soft consistency, adding the milk if needed.
4. Put the flour, beaten eggs and sesame seeds in three separate bowls. Roll the croquettes in the flour, dip in the beaten egg, then roll in the sesame seeds.
5. Heat the oil in a large, non-stick frying pan and fry the croquettes on a low-medium heat for 4-5 mins, turning frequently for an even, golden colour. Drain on kitchen paper and serve with the cream cheese dip.


3. Supergreen soup with yogurt & pine nuts

Ingredients:
2 tsp olive oil
1 onion
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 potato (approx 250g), cut into cubes
600ml vegetable stock
120g bag mixed watercress, rocket and spinach salad
150g pot natural yogurt
20g pine nuts, toasted

Method:
1. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over a low-medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt, then cook slowly, stirring occasionally, for 10 mins until softened but not coloured. Add the garlic and cook for 1 min more.
2. Tip in the potato followed by the veg stock. Simmer for 10-12 mins until the potato is soft enough that a cutlery knife will slide in easily. Add the bag of salad and let it wilt for 1 min, then blitz the soup in a blender until it’s completely smooth.
3. Serve with a dollop of yogurt, some toasted pine nuts and a drizzle of chilli oil, if you like.

4. Moroccan chickpea soup
