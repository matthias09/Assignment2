1 loaf French or Italian bread sliced into 2 inch slices
olive oil
1 clove garlic
1 medium tomato, diced
1/4 cup onion diced
6-8 large basil leaves chopped
salt to taste
balsamic glaze (optional)

Method:

6. Stir together tomatoes, onion, and basil leaves. 
7. Add salt and spoon onto the top of the grilled bread. 
8. Drizzle all slices with balsamic glaze, if you choose to use.

4. Broccoli and Potato Croquettes

Ingredients:

400g floury potatoes
150g broccoli
1 medium egg yolk
40g mature cheddar, grated
60g fresh breadcrumbs

For the crust
20g plain flour
2 medium eggs beaten
100g sesame seeds
4 tbsp olive oil

For the dip
100g cream cheese
50g natural yogurt
1 tbsp chives, snipped
1-2 tbsp full-fat milk

Method:

1. Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan and just cover with cold water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 14-16 mins until completely cooked through. Drain and mash well, then put back in the saucepan over a low heat and cook for 1-2 mins, stirring constantly – this will remove excess moisture.
2. Meanwhile, bring a small saucepan of water to the boil, add the broccoli and simmer for 6-7 mins until tender. Drain really well and pat dry with kitchen paper (it’s important to do this thoroughly as excess water will make the croquettes a little wet). Finely chop the broccoli, then add to the mashed potato with the egg yolk, cheese and breadcrumbs. Divide the mixture into 12 equal balls and roll each one into a short sausage shape. Chill for 10 mins in the freezer.
3. Meanwhile, make the dip. Put the cream cheese, yogurt and chives in a bowl and stir to a soft consistency, adding the milk if needed.
4. Put the flour, beaten eggs and sesame seeds in three separate bowls. Roll the croquettes in the flour, dip in the beaten egg, then roll in the sesame seeds.
5. Heat the oil in a large, non-stick frying pan and fry the croquettes on a low-medium heat for 4-5 mins, turning frequently for an even, golden colour. Drain on kitchen paper and serve with the cream cheese dip.


5. Supergreen soup with yogurt & pine nuts

Ingredients:

2 tsp olive oil
1 onion
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 potato (approx 250g), cut into cubes
600ml vegetable stock
120g bag mixed watercress, rocket and spinach salad
150g pot natural yogurt
20g pine nuts, toasted

Method:

1. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over a low-medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt, then cook slowly, stirring occasionally, for 10 mins until softened but not coloured. Add the garlic and cook for 1 min more.
2. Tip in the potato followed by the veg stock. Simmer for 10-12 mins until the potato is soft enough that a cutlery knife will slide in easily. Add the bag of salad and let it wilt for 1 min, then blitz the soup in a blender until it’s completely smooth.
3. Serve with a dollop of yogurt, some toasted pine nuts and a drizzle of chilli oil, if you like.

6. Moroccan chickpea soup

Ingredients:

1 tbsp olive oil
1 medium onion
2 celery sticks, chopped
2 tsp ground cumin
600ml hot vegetable stock
400g can chopped plum tomatoes with garlic
400g can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
100g frozen broad beans
zest and juice ½ lemon

Method:

1. Heat the oil in a large saucepan, then fry the onion and celery gently for 10 mins until softened, stirring frequently. Tip in the cumin and fry for another min.
2. Turn up the heat, then add the stock, tomatoes and chickpeas, plus a good grind of black pepper. Simmer for 8 mins. Throw in broad beans and lemon juice, cook for a further 2 mins. Season to taste, then top with a sprinkling of lemon zest and chopped herbs. Serve with flatbread.

5. Sweet onion and cauliflower tart

Ingredients
olive oil for frying
1 onion, sliced
1 tsp brown sugar
25g butter
1 small cauliflower, separated into florets
1 fresh bay leaf
250ml whole milk
150g wensleydale cheese, grated
50g pitted black olives, chopped
4 fresh thyme sprigs, leaves picked
3 medium free-range eggs
100ml double cream

For the pastry: 

200g plain flour, plus extra to dust
4 fresh thyme sprigs, leaves picked and roughly chopped
100g cold butter, cubed
3-4 tbsp ice-cold water

Method

1. For the pastry, pulse together the flour, thyme, a pinch of salt and the chilled butter in a food processor to make large crumbs. 
2. Sprinkle over 3 tbsp cold water and pulse again to bring the mix together to make a dough – use another tbsp water if it’s a bit dry. (Alternatively you can do this by hand in a mixing bowl – use your fingertips to rub in the butter, then use a dinner knife to mix in the water.) Tip out onto a sheet of cling film, shape into a ball, then wrap the pastry in the cling film and flatten it with your palms to make a disc.
3. Chill the pastry in the fridge for 30 minutes.
4. Heat a glug of oil in a large frying pan and fry the onion over a low-medium heat for 20 minutes until softened and slightly caramelised. Add a pinch of salt and the sugar and cook for another 5 minutes. Set aside.
5. Meanwhile, in another frying pan (with a lid), heat the butter and fry the cauliflower florets for 5 minutes, turning, until golden. 
6. Transfer half to a plate and set aside, then add the bay leaf and milk to the pan and simmer with the lid on for 10 minutes or until tender. 
7. Scoop out the cauliflower (discard the bay) and whizz in a food processor with just enough of the cooking liquid to make a purée (or do this in a bowl with a stick blender). Discard the remaining liquid. Pour the pureé into a large jug or bowl and leave to cool.
8. Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Roll out the chilled pastry on a lightly floured work surface to roughly the thickness of a £1 coin. Carefully use your rolling pin to lift the pastry and unroll it over the tin. 
9. Line the base and sides of the tart tin with the pastry, pressing it into the edges and flutes. Trim any excess with a sharp knife, leaving a small overhang.
10. Prick the base a few times with a fork, line the case with foil, then fill with baking beans or uncooked rice. Chill for another 10 minutes.
11. Bake the tart case for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and baking beans/rice and return to the oven for 6-8 minutes until the pastry is golden and feels sandy to the touch. Take the tart case out of the oven and turn the temperature down to 170°C/150°C fan/gas 3½.
12. Spoon the cooked onions over the base of the tart and scatter over half the grated cheese (see Know-how), the black olives, the reserved cauliflower florets and the thyme leaves. Beat the eggs and cream into the cooled cauliflower purée, season with black pepper, then put the tart case on a baking sheet on an oven shelf and pour in the egg mixture. Scatter over the remaining cheese and bake for 30 minutes until golden and the filling has set. 
13. Serve warm.

Desserts

1. Banoffee Pie

Ingredients:

For base:
150g digestive biscuits
75g butter
	
For the filling:
75g butter
75g light muscovado sugar
1 x 397ml tin of full-fat condensed milk
1 tsp vanilla extract

50g dark chocolate, broken into pieces

Method:
1. You will need a 20cm (8in) round, springform tin with deep sides, and a piping bag (optional). Line the sides of the tin with strips of clingfilm (using a little water to help the clingfilm stick) and then line the base with a disc of baking paper.
2. First make the pie base. Place the biscuits in a freezer bag and finely crush with a rolling pin. Melt the butter in a nonstick saucepan over a low heat, add the biscuits and combine. Spoon into the base of the tin, pressing down with the back of a spoon to level. Chill for 15 minutes.
3. To make the filling, heat the butter and sugar in the same pan and stir over a low heat until combined. Add the condensed milk, bring to the boil and heat, stirring continuously, for 2-3 minutes or until dark golden, taking care that the mixture doesn’t catch on the bottom.
