4. Broccoli and Potato Croquettes

Ingredients:

400g floury potatoes
150g broccoli
1 medium egg yolk
40g mature cheddar, grated
60g fresh breadcrumbs

For the crust
20g plain flour
2 medium eggs beaten
100g sesame seeds
4 tbsp olive oil

For the dip
100g cream cheese
50g natural yogurt
1 tbsp chives, snipped
1-2 tbsp full-fat milk

Method:

1. Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan and just cover with cold water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 14-16 mins until completely cooked through. Drain and mash well, then put back in the saucepan over a low heat and cook for 1-2 mins, stirring constantly – this will remove excess moisture.
2. Meanwhile, bring a small saucepan of water to the boil, add the broccoli and simmer for 6-7 mins until tender. Drain really well and pat dry with kitchen paper (it’s important to do this thoroughly as excess water will make the croquettes a little wet). Finely chop the broccoli, then add to the mashed potato with the egg yolk, cheese and breadcrumbs. Divide the mixture into 12 equal balls and roll each one into a short sausage shape. Chill for 10 mins in the freezer.
3. Meanwhile, make the dip. Put the cream cheese, yogurt and chives in a bowl and stir to a soft consistency, adding the milk if needed.
4. Put the flour, beaten eggs and sesame seeds in three separate bowls. Roll the croquettes in the flour, dip in the beaten egg, then roll in the sesame seeds.
5. Heat the oil in a large, non-stick frying pan and fry the croquettes on a low-medium heat for 4-5 mins, turning frequently for an even, golden colour. Drain on kitchen paper and serve with the cream cheese dip.

20g pine nuts, toasted

Method:

1. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over a low-medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt, then cook slowly, stirring occasionally, for 10 mins until softened but not coloured. Add the garlic and cook for 1 min more.
2. Tip in the potato followed by the veg stock. Simmer for 10-12 mins until the potato is soft enough that a cutlery knife will slide in easily. Add the bag of salad and let it wilt for 1 min, then blitz the soup in a blender until it’s completely smooth.
3. Serve with a dollop of yogurt, some toasted pine nuts and a drizzle of chilli oil, if you like.

8. Next level spaghetti Bolognese

Ingredients:
olive oil
400g beef mince
400g Italian pork sausages, skinned and crumbled
200g smoked pancetta
1 onion
1 carrot
2 celery sticks, finely chopped
4 garlic cloves, chopped
1 sprig thyme
small bunch fresh basil
small leaves picked and reserved
2 bay leaves
2 tsp dried oregano
handful dried porcini mushrooms
1 tsp golden caster sugar
1 tbsp tomato purée
½ tsp Thai fish sauce
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
100ml whole milk
4 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes
200ml white wine
100g parmesan
100g spaghetti

Method:
1. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan and crumble in the mince and sausagemeat. Spend a good 30 mins cooking the mince – it will release lots of liquid, which you want to evaporate, and then eventually it will end up sizzling in its own fat. If the pan becomes too dry, drizzle in a little more olive oil. Towards the end, continue stirring the mince until it becomes speckled with crisp brown bits.
2. Heat oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 2. While the mince is browning, heat a drizzle more oil in a casserole dish and sizzle the pancetta for 5 mins until it starts to brown and release its fat, then throw in the vegetables and herbs, and finely crumble over the dried porcini. Cook gently for 5 mins until soft and starting to brown. Sprinkle over the sugar, then stir in the tomato purée and splash in the fish sauce and vinegar. Simmer down until gloopy, then stir through the meat and pour in the milk and tomatoes. Rinse out the tomato tins with the wine and stir into the pan. Season, then nestle in the parmesan rind. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook in the oven for 3 hrs.
3. When cooked, tip as many portions of Bolognese as you need into a sauté pan. Cook the pasta until very al dente, then tong into the pan with a bit of the water and finish cooking with the sauce for 2 mins. Stir through the parmesan and a drizzle more olive oil. Twirl the pasta and Bolognese into bowls, scatter with basil and serve with more parmesan.

2. Heat 3/2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat, When oil is shimmering, add eggplant in a single layer, working in batches if necessary. Season with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and pepper as desired. Saute, flipping
   halfway through, until crisp on outside, about 8 minutes total. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
3. While eggplant sautes, sprinkle flour onto a clean dry surface. Using a rolling pin or the heels of your hands, roll and stretch pizza dough to about 1/4-inche thickness. Rub 1 teaspoon of olive oil on a parchment-lined bakingsheet, then carefully add pizza dough.
4. Spread the sauce over the pizza, leaving a 1-inch border. Add eggplant in an even layer.
   Top with mozzarella, then dot over ricotta salata.

6. Cut pizza into slices, garnish with basil, and dig in.

2. Pizza Margherita

For the base
300g strong bread flour
1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)
1 tsp salt

3. Sweet onion and cauliflower tart

Ingredients
olive oil for frying
1 onion, sliced
1 tsp brown sugar
25g butter
1 small cauliflower, separated into florets
1 fresh bay leaf
250ml whole milk
150g wensleydale cheese, grated
50g pitted black olives, chopped
4 fresh thyme sprigs, leaves picked
3 medium free-range eggs
100ml double cream

For the pastry: 

200g plain flour, plus extra to dust
4 fresh thyme sprigs, leaves picked and roughly chopped
100g cold butter, cubed
3-4 tbsp ice-cold water

Method

1. For the pastry, pulse together the flour, thyme, a pinch of salt and the chilled butter in a food processor to make large crumbs. 
2. Sprinkle over 3 tbsp cold water and pulse again to bring the mix together to make a dough – use another tbsp water if it’s a bit dry. (Alternatively you can do this by hand in a mixing bowl – use your fingertips to rub in the butter, then use a dinner knife to mix in the water.) Tip out onto a sheet of cling film, shape into a ball, then wrap the pastry in the cling film and flatten it with your palms to make a disc.
3. Chill the pastry in the fridge for 30 minutes.
4. Heat a glug of oil in a large frying pan and fry the onion over a low-medium heat for 20 minutes until softened and slightly caramelised. Add a pinch of salt and the sugar and cook for another 5 minutes. Set aside.
5. Meanwhile, in another frying pan (with a lid), heat the butter and fry the cauliflower florets for 5 minutes, turning, until golden. 
6. Transfer half to a plate and set aside, then add the bay leaf and milk to the pan and simmer with the lid on for 10 minutes or until tender. 
7. Scoop out the cauliflower (discard the bay) and whizz in a food processor with just enough of the cooking liquid to make a purée (or do this in a bowl with a stick blender). Discard the remaining liquid. Pour the pureé into a large jug or bowl and leave to cool.
8. Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Roll out the chilled pastry on a lightly floured work surface to roughly the thickness of a £1 coin. Carefully use your rolling pin to lift the pastry and unroll it over the tin. 
9. Line the base and sides of the tart tin with the pastry, pressing it into the edges and flutes. Trim any excess with a sharp knife, leaving a small overhang.
10. Prick the base a few times with a fork, line the case with foil, then fill with baking beans or uncooked rice. Chill for another 10 minutes.
11. Bake the tart case for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and baking beans/rice and return to the oven for 6-8 minutes until the pastry is golden and feels sandy to the touch. Take the tart case out of the oven and turn the temperature down to 170°C/150°C fan/gas 3½.
12. Spoon the cooked onions over the base of the tart and scatter over half the grated cheese (see Know-how), the black olives, the reserved cauliflower florets and the thyme leaves. Beat the eggs and cream into the cooled cauliflower purée, season with black pepper, then put the tart case on a baking sheet on an oven shelf and pour in the egg mixture. Scatter over the remaining cheese and bake for 30 minutes until golden and the filling has set. 
13. Serve warm.

5. Pizza Marinara

Ingredients: 

1 garlic clove
all-purpose flour for dusting
Pizza Dough for one 9-inch pizza
114g Pizza Sauce
a pinch dried oregano, crumbled
15g extra-virgin olive oil

Method: 

1. At least 45 minutes before baking pizza, put a pizza stone or 4 to 6 unglazed "quarry" tiles arranged close together on oven rack in lowest position in oven and preheat oven to highest setting (500°F-550°F).
2. Thinly slice garlic. On a lightly floured surface pat out dough evenly with your fingers, keeping hands flat and lifting and turning dough over several times, into a 9-inch round. (Do not handle dough more than necessary. If dough is sticky, dust it lightly with flour.)
3. Dust a baker's peel or rimless baking sheet with flour and carefully transfer dough to it. Jerk peel or baking sheet once or twice and, if dough is sticking, lift dough and sprinkle flour underneath it, reshaping dough if necessary. Working quickly, top dough with sauce, spreading with back of a spoon to within 1/2 inch of edge. 
4. Scatter garlic and oregano over sauce and drizzle with oil.
5. Line up far edge of peel or baking sheet with far edge of stone or tiles and tilt peel or baking sheet, jerking it gently to start pizza moving. Once edge of pizza touches stone or tiles, carefully pull back peel or baking sheet, completely transferring pizza to stone or tiles (do not move pizza). 
6. Bake pizza 6 to 7 minutes, or until dough is crisp and browned, and transfer with a metal spatula to a cutting board.
7. Cut pizza into wedges and serve immediately.

6. Pizza Calzone

Ingredients: 

1 classic pizza crust 
42 small pepperoni slices 
128g sliced mushrooms, well drained 
170g sliced pimiento-stuffed green olives
227g thinly sliced provolone cheese
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
400g pizza sauce, heated

Method:

1. Heat oven to 375°F. Lightly grease 12-inch pizza pan. Unroll 1 can of dough; placing in greased pan. Starting at center, press out dough with hands to edge of pan. Layer pepperoni, mushrooms, olives and provolone cheese over dough.
2. Unroll remaining can of dough. Press out dough on work surface to form 12-inch round. Fold dough in half; place over provolone cheese and unfold. Press outside edges to seal. Cut several slits in top crust for steam to escape. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
3.Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until crust is deep golden brown. Cut pizza into wedges; serve with warm pizza sauce.


1. Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.
2. Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
3. Roll out the dough: If you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
4. Top and bake: Heat oven to 240C/fan 220C /gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp.
5.Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
