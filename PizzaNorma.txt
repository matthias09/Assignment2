Pizza Norma:

Ingredients:
28.3g Ricotta Salata
1 Eggplant
3.5g Fresh Basil
453.6g Pizza Dough
226.8g Pizza Sauce
1 Parchment Paper
28.6g Flour
113.4g Mozzarella Cheese

Method:
1. Preheat oven the 450 degrees farenheit. Rinse eggplant, halve lengthwise, 
   and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices. Tear mozzarella into small pieces.
2. Heat 3/2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat, When oil
   is shimmering, add eggplant in a single layer, working in batches if necessary. 
   Season with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and pepper as desired. Saute, flipping
   halfway through, until crisp on outside, about 8 minutes total. Transfer
   to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
3. While eggplant sautes, sprinkle flour onto a clean dry surface. Using a 
   rolling pin or the heels of your hands, roll and stretch pizza dough to about
   1/4-inche thickness. Rub 1 teaspoon of olive oil on a parchment-lined baking 
   sheet, then carefully add pizza dough.
4. Spread the sauce over the pizza, leaving a 1-inch border. Add eggplant in an even layer.
   Top with mozzarella, then dot over ricotta salata. 
5. Transfer pizza to bottom rack of oven and bake until crust is crisp and light 
   golden and cheese is bubbling, 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse basil and tear
   leaves into bite-size pieces, discarding stems. 
6. Cut pizza into slices, garnish with basil, and dig in.
